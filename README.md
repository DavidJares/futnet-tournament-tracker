# BracketBird

A lightweight PHP tournament management system for futnet and similar sports.

BracketBird is built for small and medium local tournaments that need a practical admin workflow, public display screens, and shared-hosting-friendly deployment.

## Feature Overview

- Superadmin setup and authentication
- Tournament creation and management
- Tournament-admin access per tournament slug
- Team management and group assignment (manual + auto-balanced)
- Group stage match generation, scheduling, and score entry
- Standings with tie-break logic
- Knockout bracket generation with progression and dependent reset protection
- Public read-only screens (overview, next matches, standings, schedule, knockout, results)
- Rotating public display mode with QR links
- Public overview metadata (title, description, logo, map URL/embed)

## Stack

- PHP 8.x
- MySQL/MariaDB (PDO)
- Server-rendered pages
- Vanilla JS (small UX helpers)
- Bootstrap via CDN

## Quick Start (Local)

1. Copy local config:
   - `src/Config/local.example.php` -> `src/Config/local.php`
2. Fill DB credentials in `src/Config/local.php`.
   - Public "Now" labels use the viewer browser timezone when JavaScript is available. `app.timezone` or `APP_TIMEZONE` is only an optional server fallback.
3. Run migrations:
   - `php scripts/migrate.php`
4. Configure web root to `public/`.
5. Open `/setup` and create the first superadmin.
6. Sign in at `/admin/login`.

## 🚀 Deployment (Shared Hosting)

BracketBird is designed to run on standard shared hosting (e.g. Wedos, Websupport).

### Basic steps

1. Upload project files (FTP or Git)
2. Create MySQL database
3. Create config file:

   `src/config/local.php`

4. Fill database credentials:
```php
return [
    'db' => [
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'name' => 'DB_NAME',
        'user' => 'DB_USER',
        'pass' => 'DB_PASS',
        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
    ],
];
```

5. Set environment:

   `APP_ENV=prod`

6. Run migrations:

   via CLI:

   `php scripts/migrate.php`

or temporarily via browser (if CLI is not available)

7. Open:

   `/setup`

8. Create first superadmin

## Security Summary

- CSRF protection on POST actions
- Session cookie hardening (`httponly`, `samesite`, `secure` on HTTPS)
- Session ID regeneration on login/logout
- Session-based login throttling
- Prepared statements via PDO
- Upload validation (size, extension, MIME) and upload execution blocking
- Internal folder protection for shared-hosting fallback setups
- Production-safe error display controls and baseline security headers

## Current Status

BracketBird is an MVP with working:

- tournament administration
- group stage flow
- knockout generation and progression
- bracket views
- public display pages

The project is designed for incremental extension without introducing framework or build-tool complexity.

## UI Foundation

BracketBird includes a shared visual layer at `public/assets/css/bracketbird.css`.
It sits on top of Bootstrap CDN styles and provides the dark sports-product theme, admin shell, responsive navigation, themed cards, forms, tables, badges, match/bracket cards, flash messages, and public display styling.
No frontend build pipeline is required.

Admin pages support a browser-local dark/light theme preference stored in `localStorage`.
Public screens use the tournament-specific `public_view_theme` setting so a tournament can choose either the dark broadcast theme or a lighter outdoor-friendly theme independently from the admin UI.

The Tournament Settings admin tab uses a responsive product-style configuration layout with themed cards for general information, tournament structure, match rules, access, and the save action bar while preserving the existing server-rendered form behavior.
